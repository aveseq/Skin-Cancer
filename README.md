The project presents deep learning-based Hybrid models includes InceptionV3 and DenseNet121 to identify the skin cancer in images with 224 x 224 pixels, using two datasets: HAM10000 and ISIC2020. The proposed scheme achieves good result of accuracy with 99.91% and 91.50% in HAM10000 and ISIC2020 respectively. To show its performance, the other standard models were tested that are DenseNet121 with 99.10%, MobileNetV2 with 97.54%, and InceptionV3 with 91.43%. It classifies skin cancer type, identifies cancer lessions and shows it.
